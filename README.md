# Video Rag 🎥 🛠️

Query on Videos from YT by providing the URL
Drop a YouTube URL, and I’ll handle the rest:

- QA on the video
- Timestamps & frames for answers
- Precise answers delivered

---

### Steps to Replicate 👨‍💻

- Create a Python Environment of your choice
- Git clone the repo `git clone <repo>`
- `cd video_rag_app`
- Install Requirements file `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app file `python3 src/app.py`

---

**Important** - Clear the DB Index on UI [side bar button] before you upload a YT url + GEMINI API KEY and click on submit.
